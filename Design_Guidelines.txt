---------------------------------------------------------------------
Startiing with simple Color scheme and bootstrap theme for now,
but will soon be advancing to more creative options as we progress

Global Elements list - These items will almost always have
the exact same set up on every page

Navbar
Header
footer
Text - we can pull in a few groovy fonts from Google fonts
Backgrounds - 
Buttons - The buttons will probably have some variety between them

Unique Elements List - These items should be considered to be creatively flexible

Sign up form - 
input fields - Consider using inner glow or a drop shadow

Game grid - Basic design first then complex design later if we get to it.
Once the grid is designed and working then we can add flair and play around with creative ideas
